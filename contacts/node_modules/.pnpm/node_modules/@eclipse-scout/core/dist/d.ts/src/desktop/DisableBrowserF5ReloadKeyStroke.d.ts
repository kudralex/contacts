/**
 * Global key stroke on the desktop that prevents 'leaking' of the F5 keystroke to the browser.
 *
 * F5 is used in Scout applications to reload table pages or invoke application-specific logic.
 * If the application does not consume the key, some browsers would reload the page. This can
 * be confusing and annoying for the user. For example when the user presses F5 on a table
 * page to reload the data, but the table is covered with a glass pane (e.g. busy indicator
 * is active because of slow network connection), the browser would simply reload the page
 * (i.e. create a new UiSession) instead of updating the data from the database.
 *
 * To reload the page, the general key stroke 'Ctrl-R' ('Command-R' on Macintosh, respectively)
 * should be used instead.
